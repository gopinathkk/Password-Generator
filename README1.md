# Password-Generator

Password Generator is an application which was assigned as the homework for  week 3 of Monash Uni Bootcamp.

This Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes
